# Repository for Data Structures 
    - Studies made in Python for the Data Structures class in 2025 at PUCPR for the masters mandatory classes.
    - This repo contains codes for: (Linear Arrays, Binary Search Tree (BST) and Hash Tables)
    - The goal of this first Job is to review the differences between each data structure and make a report that includes detailed analysis of computer resource usage, the data inside the algorithms during the experiments.
    - In order to run the BST files, run only the "main.py" file.
    - Only  execute `python .\arrays_collect_metrics.py` to run the Arrays code comparison. 
    - Essay made by:  Andreia Carpi, Kalebe Rodrigues Szlachta, Márcio Venâncio e Rafaela Moura.
